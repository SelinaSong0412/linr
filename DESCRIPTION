Description: "linr" is used to fit a linear model. In this function, linear regression can be done by three matrix decomposition methods, which are the QR decomposition, Cholesky decomposition and the singular value decomposition (SVD). The defalt fitting method used is the Cholesky decomposition method. All three decomposition methods can fit linear model with high efficiency.
