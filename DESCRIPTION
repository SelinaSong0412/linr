Description: Function "linr" is used to fit a linear regression model by matrix decomposition method with high efficiency.    The regression can be done by three matrix decomposition methods, which are the QR decomposition, Cholesky decomposition and the singular value decomposition (SVD).    The defalt fitting method used is the Cholesky decomposition method which is used in "lm" function in "stats" package. All three methods can fit linear model with high efficiency.
